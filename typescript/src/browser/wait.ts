 * - the author's `loading` locator showing (for as long as it shows);
 * - a generic loading sign, within `region` when one is named, coming, going, or new: a busy
 *   region, an indeterminate progress bar, or a skeleton, shimmer, spinner or loader class (never
 *   on a form control) counts while it shows until it has held for `noProgressMs`. Determinate
 *   bars (ratings, steps, meters) never count, and signs showing before the action in the same
 *   number, or class hints already there at the first look, are the page's own decoration. One
 *   page call counts them at each look; a sign element in content the browser skips rendering
 *   does not show, and a look whose count runs out of time takes the class hints as unchanged.
 *   `waitForRows` also counts a sign beside its rows (in their container or the element around
 *   it, never inside a row, and only when it is visible): one there before the action, in the
 *   same number, is the page's own; any other counts while it shows, until it and the rows have
 *   held for `noProgressMs` with no request the action started in flight;
 * - DOM changes inside the author's `region` (never the whole page: carousels and ads never stop);
 * - one of the site's own `document`, `xhr` or `fetch` requests in flight (the site is
 *   `siteDomain`, else a conservative guess from the page's host). A request the action started
 *   counts until it ends, up to `lateFillCap`, and the page then gets `unchangedMs` to render its
 *   answer; any other counts for 10 s and keeps the page busy for 4 s, since long-polls and
 *   streams stay open. Beacons, images, fonts and media never count, and a request repeated with
 *   the same method, URL and body (numbers aside) at a steady interval is a poll and is ignored;
 * - the page's URL changing, or the page being replaced;
 * - the wait's own reads changing: an outcome's matches, rows or values filling or changing.
 *
 * Network activity alone never proves the content is coming; it only keeps a wait alive.

/**
 * Page code for a Kernel call body, where `page` is in scope: paste it once at the top of the code
 * string, then wait with your verified Playwright locators. It declares the waits below, which share
 * one set of limits (`waitLimits`, from `timeoutDefaults`) and one progress budget, and
 * `waitReport()`.
 *
 * Every wait returns as soon as its condition holds: a ready page costs `waitForOutcome` one look,
 * and the value waits two looks `settle` (0.5 s) apart. While it waits it watches the page's
 * progress: the site's own loading sign passed as `loading`, for as long as it shows; a generic
 * sign (a busy region, an indeterminate progress bar, a skeleton, shimmer, spinner or loader class,
 * within `region` when named) only while it is new, so a decoration holds a wait for at most one
 * no-progress window, and one there before the action not at all; DOM changes
 * inside the `region` you name; one of the site's own document or API requests in flight (beacons,
 * polls and long-open requests aside; pass the context's `siteDomain` to say which hosts are the
 * site's); the URL changing; and the wait's own reads filling or changing. It keeps waiting while progress
 * continues, up to `timeout`, and fails once nothing has progressed for `noProgressMs` (default
 * `answer`, 8 s). A failure is an `Error` with a `reason`, and a message that names the reason, what
 * each outcome or field showed (counts and states, never page text), which progress signs it saw
 * and when progress stopped. `waitReport()` returns one record per wait this call ran, each with a
 * `summary` sentence: return it from a probe to see how each wait ended.
 *
 * `waitForOutcome(outcomes, { action, loading, region, siteDomain, noProgressMs, timeout,
 * unchangedMs }?)` waits for whichever of the page's possible answers appears, after a step whose
 * answer can vary, such as a search, a filter, a date pick or a submit, and returns its key.
 * `outcomes` names one locator per answer, highest priority first, such as `{ refused, failed,
 * unavailable, empty, results }`: when several show at once, the first listed wins, so list a
 * refusal, the site's error or a greyed-out choice before an empty state, and an empty state before
 * results. Each locator names one element, such as the results list rather than its rows. It only
 * observes: about every 100 ms it counts each locator's matches and its visible ones, and never
 * clicks, types or navigates itself. It answers at the first look that shows an outcome.
 * `timeout` (default `answerCap`, 30 s) is the hard cap, reached only while the page keeps
 * progressing. `action` is the step itself, such as `() => apply.click()`, which it runs exactly
 * once, after noting what each outcome showed: a match that was visible before it, with the same
 * text, counts only once it has stayed so for `unchangedMs` (default 2000) and no request the
 * action started is still in flight, or was as the look began. Such a request holds it back for
 * at most `lateFillCap` (15 s), and never past `timeout` less `unchangedMs`, so the match still
 * counts before the timeout.
 * `timeout`, `noProgressMs` and `unchangedMs` start once the action returns; `deadline`, a
 * `Date.now()` time such as the call's own, ends the wait by then however long the action took. Its
 * `OutcomeWaitFailure` has `observations` (`OutcomeObservation` by key) and one of these reasons:
 *
 * - `outcome_ambiguous`, when the winning outcome's locator matches more than one element; its
 *   `outcome` is that key. Scope the locator, for example with `.filter({ visible: true })`.
 * - `outcome_unknown`, when no outcome shows and the page made no progress for `noProgressMs`: a
 *   challenge, the site's error or a layout the code does not handle, never slowness.
 * - `outcome_timeout`, when the page was still progressing at `timeout`.
 *
 * An outcome may also be an object naming one declared kind, raced beside the locators in the same
 * listed order, so a site that answers in a way the code did not expect still ends the wait:
 *
 * - `{ gone: locator, stableMs? }`: the element, visible before the action (or at a look), has
 *   had no visible match for `stableMs` (default 300), such as a form or a modal closing. A form
 *   redrawn in place within that time is not gone.
 * - `{ invalid: locator }`: a control inside it is marked invalid (`aria-invalid="true"`, the
 *   `is-invalid` class, or the browser's own check after a submit). Fields flagged before the
 *   action, and unchanged, follow the same `unchangedMs` rule as a locator.
 * - `{ url }`: the page's URL matches a string (the whole URL, its path, or path and query), a
 *   RegExp or a function of the `URL`. After an `action` it counts only once the page navigated,
 *   by a document load or a route change, so an edit page whose URL already matched waits.
 * - `{ response }`: a response arrived, from before the action, that a function of the Playwright
 *   `Response` accepts, or that matches `{ method, url, status, navigation }` (`status` a number,
 *   `[low, high]` or a function). It races the page's answers, so a request the site batches,
 *   caches or renames never hangs the wait: name one only for a write's commit request.
 * - `{ dialog: true | type | [types] }`: a native dialog opened, even one the action's own click
 *   raised. Page scripts stop while it is open, so it decides at once, and a dialog of a type no
 *   outcome names fails as `outcome_unknown`. The wait never accepts or dismisses it: a dialog
 *   that opened while it listened is on the result's or failure's `dialog`, whichever won. An
 *   action still waiting to click when a dialog opens clicks once the dialog is handled, so
 *   handle it before ending the call.
 * - `{ popup: true | (page) => boolean }`: the page opened a new tab or window.
 * - `{ announced: string | RegExp }`: a live region (`aria-live`, or the role `alert`, `status`,
 *   `log` or `alertdialog`) announced matching text after the action, as a screen reader hears
 *   it. A toast that comes and goes between two looks still counts.
 * - `{ check: async () => value }`: a condition of your own, true once it returns a truthy value.
 *   It has no stale rule: one already true before the action wins at the first look.
 *
 * `waitForOutcomeResult(outcomes, options?)` is the same wait returning `OutcomeResult`: the
 * winning `outcome` and its `kind`, `afterMs`, `looks`, the `observations`, and `evidence` of what
 * showed it (a locator's visible text, the invalid fields' labels and messages, the URL reached,
 * the response's method, URL and status, the dialog's type and message). The winning Playwright
 * `response`, `dialog` or popup `page` is on the result too, kept off its JSON. Every listener
 * the losing outcomes used is removed before it returns or throws.
 *
 * `waitForRows(rows, fields, { count, key, ...options })` waits until the first `count` identified
 * rows have every field filled and read the same on two looks `stableMs` apart (default `settle`,
 * 0.5 s), and returns `{ rows: [{ key, ...fields }], more }`. `rows` is a locator for every row;
 * `key` and each field are a CSS selector inside the row, or `{ selector, attribute, optional,
 * placeholder }` (no selector reads the row itself), read from its first visible match; a needed
 * text field whose matches are all hidden is reported `hidden`. A row without a key is a
 * placeholder slot and is skipped. When fewer identified rows than `count` exist, it returns them
 * once their count and values held for `unchangedMs`, no loading sign beside the rows still counts,
 * no request the action started is in flight, and no other site request started under 4 s ago is;
 * no identified row at all
 * is never an answer, so decide an empty list with `waitForOutcome` first. Options also take
 * `action` (run once first, such as a "load more" click), `loading`, `region`, `siteDomain`,
 * `noProgressMs` and `timeout` (default `lateFillCap`, 15 s).
 *
 * `waitForValues(fields, options?)` waits until each named field (a Playwright locator, or
 * `{ locator, attribute, all, optional, placeholder }`) is filled in and the values read the same
 * on two looks, and returns `{ values }`. `all` reads every visible match as a list.
 *
 * `waitForChange(fields, { before, action, ...options })` waits, after a choice, for the values
 * that depend on it: it returns `{ values, changed }` once they differ from `before` (or from what
 * they were before `action` ran) and hold, or once they stayed the same for `unchangedMs` with no
 * progress sign showing, so a loading sign or request the choice started must first go.
 *
 * `waitForReady(control, { overlays, expand, dismiss, pending, until, editable, stableMs,
 * dismissLimit, watch, deadline, ...options })` waits before an action until the control's one visible
 * match is attached, visible, enabled (and not read-only when `editable`), not busy (no
 * `aria-busy` around it, no spinner inside it), in the same place on two looks, and what a click
 * at its centre would hit is the control itself, not an overlay. It also waits while an `overlays`
 * locator shows, while `pending` (a function run in the page, such as
 * `() => window.jQuery?.active ?? 0`) returns a truthy count, and until `until()` is true. Once
 * anything held it back, ready must hold for `stableMs` (default `settle`), so a spinner that
 * flickers off between two requests does not count as gone. `expand` names the toggle of the
 * control's section: it clicks it once while the control is hidden and the toggle says the
 * section is collapsed (`aria-expanded` false, or the summary of a closed `details`), so it never
 * closes an open one. `dismiss`
 * names the close or skip controls of panels that open on their own, such as a tour, a what's-new
 * dialog or a cookie banner: it clicks one that shows, up to `dismissLimit` (5) times, and once
 * ready keeps a Playwright locator handler on each, so one that opens later is closed before the
 * next action, until `result.release()` or `dismissLimit` uses (`watch: false` skips it). It
 * returns `ReadyResult`, and fails as a `ReadyWaitFailure` with `blockers` and a message naming
 * what held it back last: `not_ready` once nothing progressed for `noProgressMs`, `ready_timeout`
 * at `timeout` (default `answerCap`), `ready_ambiguous` when more than one visible element
 * matches.
 *
 * A value is still loading, never absent, while it is empty, reads as a loading word or only dots,
 * matches the field's `placeholder` pattern, or sits in an `aria-busy`, skeleton or shimmer
 * element. An `optional` field may be absent and is then `null`; a needed one may not. A value
 * still loading when progress stops fails with `values_loading`, whether optional or not;
 * `change_unknown` when waitForChange's fields are missing; `values_timeout` at the cap. Each is a
 * `ValueWaitFailure`.

 * adds no error, while one more message with an old text is new.
 *
 * It judges the commit from the `{ response }` answer of the click's `waitForOutcomeResult` and
 * the page, and returns `CommitConfirmation`, plain data a call can return. It never marks a write
 * done or not done without proof: whatever the response and the page leave open is `unclear`.
 *
 * - A response that is not 2xx or 3xx is `not_done`; a 201 with a Location is `done` at once. A 3xx
 *   whose Location is the page that posted (same path), or whose query names an error or failure,
 *   is `unclear` unless the page shows an error.
 * - A 2xx body that reads as JSON is `not_done` for a success field (`success`, `succeeded`,
 *   `isSuccess`, any case) that is false, `"false"`, 0 or `"no"` or holds an error word, `ok:
 *   false`, an error field holding an error (not empty, and not a word for none such as "No
 *   error"), a status of 400 or more, or an error word in a status or message. An error field is
 *   any named for errors up to two levels down, and `error`, `errors` or `userErrors` up to four;
 *   true counts only under `error`, `errors` or `hasError(s)`, and a setting such as
 *   `notifyOnError` is never one. It is `unclear` for a success field holding anything but true,
 *   `"true"`, 1, `"yes"`, `"ok"` or `"success"`, or a status or message that refuses a value
 *   ("required", "unable", "could not") or says declined, rejected or denied, words a write may
 *   itself have meant. A string holding JSON, as in `{ d: "..." }`, is read too. A body that is
 *   neither JSON nor HTML, or can't be read within 1 s, is `unclear`; a 3xx's or an empty one is no
 *   body.
 * - The page then gets the settle window (`settle`, 0.5 s). A field newly marked invalid, or a
 *   message whose text is new with words of an error or a refusal, is `not_done`, whatever the
 *   body's message said. A message is an alert, an assertive live region or anything styled as an
 *   error, with letters, outside links, buttons and labels, and not one only a screen reader hears.
 *   A new message styled as an error with no such words, one that mixes them with a success, one
 *   that says declined, rejected or denied, an alert that says neither error nor success, or a
 *   field still marked invalid as before, is `unclear`.
 * - Otherwise the commit is `done`: `queued` for a 202, or a body whose status says queued, pending
 *   or processing, with that word as `status_label`, else `completed`. An outcome with no response
 *   is `not_done` when the page shows a new error, else `unclear`. A native dialog that opened
 *   during the wait and says the write failed is `not_done`; while one stays open the page can't
 *   be read, which is `unclear`.
 *
 * It never clicks, and it reads the body for at most 1 s and the page for at most about 2 s.
