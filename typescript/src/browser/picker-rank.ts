/**
 * The one option `wanted` names, a list of spellings of one choice, by rank: a name or the value
 * as written (trimmed), then ignoring case and spacing, then also ignoring accents and
 * punctuation (`fold`), then, only with `options.leading`, a name whose leading part, its text
 * before its first comma that is not between two digits, is a spelling, folded the same way
 * (`leading`: York, UK for York, but not 1,000 miles for 1), then a name holding a spelling as
 * whole words (New York for York), then a name holding every word of a spelling, in any order,
 * among its own (`allWords`: Seattle, WA - King Street Station for Seattle King Street, or 12 Main
 * St, Springfield 62701 for 12 Main St 62701), then, only with `options.stem`, a name whose words pair one
 * for one, in order, with a spelling's (`stem`), as a read asks for and a write never does. Two
 * words pair when they are equal, or when both are Latin letters only and the shorter, of five or
 * more letters, is the whole start of the longer, such as Dentist and Dentistry or Dentists and
 * Dentist, but not Employee and Employer, County and Country, Physician and Physics, Adam and
 * Adams, or UK and Ukraine. The value never matches by stem. A name beats the value at each rank.
 * Options at the first rank that matches decide: one option (by key) is picked, or reported
 * disabled when every copy of it is; two or more are ambiguous, never guessed. A weaker rank never
 * overrules a stronger one, so a disabled exact match is not replaced by a looser one. Without
 * `options.leading`, no option ranks `leading`; without `options.stem`, none ranks `stem`.
 *
 * It is pure and self-contained: the page code of `pickerCode` embeds this same function with
 * `fold` set to `foldChoiceText`.
