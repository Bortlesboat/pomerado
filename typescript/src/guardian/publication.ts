The record lists only the versions that ship: an HTTP version the minter ruled out, or a Playwright version a tool published as HTTP alone does not ship, is absent, and its results, failures and gaps are never a finding; each retired case, by version, (one the minter deleted, changed after it failed, or that failed and then passed when run again unchanged on the same source, marked flaky) with its last verdict and input; and notTested, what the minter chose not to test and why. A case's outputChecks are the host's output check findings on that case's output: leads like those in publication/output-notes.json, judged by the same output rules, never a finding by themselves. Each version's results come only from batches run on that version: judge each version's coverage, and the HTTP version's parity with the Playwright version, from that version's own results, never from the other's. Judge test coverage from it against the tool's claims (its description and its input and output schemas) and the captures, not from the minter's coverage text, and judge each case by its input and result, never by its purpose alone. Test results never refuse publication by themselves: a finding needs a claim a result contradicts, or a claim left untested while time remained.",
  "A case whose status is fail on a version shows an input that version does not handle as its schema claims: a schema_mismatch finding, reason source_correction, at the source line its frame names, or at that input's schema text when it names none, on that version's source; a case that passes on one version and fails on the other is a parity gap in the failing version, never excused by the passing one, unless the case asks for something the schema never claims. A retired case whose last verdict is fail counts the same while the schema still claims its input, unless the record names its excusedBy or its outsideSchema. excusedBy is a case that passes the same input on the published source after the source changed, with the same expectation or with a refusal the retired case's own expectation accepts. outsideSchema is the host's finding that the published input schema bounds a value that input supplied, at the path and by the keyword it names, such as a maximum length on its query or a property the schema no longer takes; the host never marks it for a field the schema newly requires or a rule over the whole input. With outsideSchema, the failure no longer counts: judge only that bound, as a schema_mismatch finding, reason source_correction, at its schema text when the captures show the site accepts values past it, such as its own field taking a longer value, or when it excludes a value the site offers, by the input schema review's rule that the schema accepts what the site's field accepts and an enum lists the site's full set of options. Its changedExpectationBy, a case that passes the same input with a changed expectation, excuses it only when a capture shows the site's own answer for that exact input matching the new expectation, reached through the site's own controls or a URL its controls produce, never a challenge, sign-in, blocked or loading page. For an expectation of empty, that is a page that reads back that input as the site applied it and shows the site's no-results state, never an error page. For an expectation of result, it is a page that reads back that input as the site applied it and lists the site's own results for it, such as near matches the site shows for a query nothing matches exactly, never an error page. For an expectation of invalid_input or error, it is the site's own controls refusing that exact input: the site's own validation message for it on its own form, or, where the captures hold the site's responses, a 400, 413, 414 or 422 response to the request the site's own form sent with it. The request a run of the tool made never counts, since the tool built it and a mis-encoded value or a missing token in it draws the same answer as a real refusal; neither does a 401, 403, 404, 405 or 429 response, a 5xx, a timeout or a challenge. In each case, the case's purpose or the minter's coverage text names that capture. Nothing else excuses it: not another case with the same purpose, not a changed expectation the captures do not show the site giving, and not a pass on the same source with the same expectation, which makes it flaky. A flaky case shows a missing wait or a race: the same finding at its frame. A case that expects error, empty or invalid_input for an input the tool claims to handle (a value the site offers, or a record, store or place the captures show results for) tests nothing even when it passes: judge it as a failing case of that input, unless a capture of the site's own controls shows the site's own answer for that exact input matching its expectation, by the same test as changedExpectationBy above: such a case tests the empty result or the site's refusal. Each retired case that still counts carries the host's clearedBy: ways, the ways that can still clear it; siteAnswer, when it has a changedExpectationBy, the site's answer that lead needs a capture of (results, no_results or refusal), with refusalStatuses, the statuses that show a refusal; and a note. A finding about a case or a retired case in publication/tests.json names what clears it: the case to add or fix, the input, or the schema change, never \"correct the record\", which only the host writes. When what clears it is evidence the minter can gather, such as the capture of the site's own answer its changedExpectationBy needs, return reason evidence and name that evidence. A failure that a source fix and a case passing its input after that fix would clear (excusedBy) is always a finding, even when outOfTime is true or no conclusive run remains. Note a retired failure in the rationale only, never as a finding, when no case, source, schema or capture change could ever clear it. Never ask for the cases to run again on the same source, which clears nothing.",
  "A case marked noMatch expects result and is the minter's no-match case for a count or total, whose answer to an input that matches nothing is zero. Prefer to count it as that only when a capture its purpose names shows the site applying that input, by the same test as changedExpectationBy above, and answering with zero or no records, and the case's output reports that count or total as 0; otherwise return a finding at that case, reason evidence, naming the capture it needs. That capture also excuses a retired failure of the same input whose changedExpectationBy is that case, as its clearedBy siteAnswer no_results says, though the case expects result.",
  "A claim is tested on a version when a case that passes on that version's published source exercises it; a stale or not_run result tests nothing. Judge the gaps below for each version the record lists, and only those: a capability no HTTP result tests is a gap of a listed HTTP version even when the Playwright version's results test it. A claimed capability no passing case exercises is a gap: a declared input when no case uses it, or changes it from its default, inputs that share a control or could undo each other set together, a list's next page, another record, retailer or store the site offers whose pages differ from the example's, a tailoring input applied, and one the site won't apply returned with the applied value. The paging fields core's listOutputFields adds (next_cursor, next_cursor_expires_at, has_more, total_results, list_changed and next_cursor_unavailable) are core's own contract, filled by core's readList and tested in core: a passing next-page case tests the tool's paging, and a list that never changed between a case's calls is no gap, since a build cannot make a site's list change; prefer noting it in the rationale only. An input is tested when one passing case uses it, or changes it from its default: its other values, such as each option of a sort, need no case of their own and no notTested entry, unless the captures show that value opens a page laid out differently. A changed order or filter alone is not a different layout. One case may cover several inputs set together when its output shows each was applied; a case whose combination returns no results tests the empty result, not the inputs it set. Cases that only repeat the example's values, or vary them mechanically, while the captures show the site offers other records, retailers or layouts the tool claims to handle, leave those claims untested. When a gap leaves a capability the definition claims untested, return an unsupported_claim finding, reason evidence, at that capability's definition or schema text, naming what no case tests, so the minter runs or fixes the cases. Note these in the rationale only, never as a finding: a gap that puts no claim in doubt; a gap whose cases are only inconclusive (a challenge, a host fault or the deadline); a version whose coldPasses is 0, so no case passed on a new browser with an empty profile (a host with one browser runs none cold), since warm cases ran on a browser that kept site data earlier steps left; and every gap when outOfTime is true, meaning the attempt ran out of time for tests. Each notTested entry needs a reason the captures, the request or the caller's answers support; an unsupported one is a gap. A record with no cases means nothing beyond the example ran live: judge every claimed capability the example did not exercise as such a gap. A record with a problem and no cases means the host could not build it: judge coverage as when it is absent. In maintenance, judge failing cases and only the capabilities the repaired failure and the repair's changes touch, and note other gaps in the rationale only. Only a read signed out's coverage is judged this way; a signed-in read's few cases are judged as the next paragraph says. When publication/tests.json is absent from a read signed out, its host runs no live test batches: judge its coverage by the same rules from the minter's coverage text, the live tests trusted_execution_context lists and the captures.",
  "Judge the tool as it is now, never as the original request, an earlier version or the tool before a repair was: a write when publication/session/ holds its act steps, a read when publication/example-output.json holds its example, and signed in when this build's executions in trusted_execution_context show a verified sign-in on the current site: one that ran under the revision of the latest update in trusted_authority.taskUpdates that changed the site, or later. A write build proves the tool with one run, its act session, and designs no further tests: the host keeps no publication/tests.json for it, and its HTTP version is checked once, against that run. A signed-in read proves the tool with its example and live tests on at most four inputs beyond it, run on its own signed-in browser. Its publication/tests.json, marked signedIn, is present only when such a case ran, and holds only cases run signed in. For a write, judge its run; for a signed-in read, its example and those cases: whether their output, the executed source and the captures support the tool's claims, by the rules above and below. A signed-in read's failing case, or retired case whose last verdict is fail, is a finding as for a read signed out. Never return a finding, or ask for another run, a live test or an offline test, because an input, value, layout, page or other capability was not tested beyond those runs; the coverage text's untested items, notTested and a signed-in read's cases not_run are disclosure, not gaps.

A needed value may be null only where that record's page genuinely does not show it, and then a required field beside it says why, such as the record's availability. Null never covers a value the page shows that the code failed to read: source that turns a missing element or a failed read of a needed value into null is the same finding, at that source. Judge every needed value's field against the whole standard in one pass and return each gap in this review: required, not nullable, non-empty and not whitespace alone, its format held by a pattern where it has one (a date, time or identifier code), and no looser than the input it reports.

Inputs that tailor the answer (a location, store, delivery or pickup mode, vehicle, membership or rate type, and the like) are the exception in a read: once the code has tried each way the captures show the site offering to set that value, returning the site's results with the value it actually applied, read back from the page and shown beside the caller's value with the site's message, is right; so is a description saying the site picks the value when the caller gives none, or may apply another, which the output labels; code that skips a way the captures show, hides that the applied value differs, or presents the results as the caller's is this finding, and its fix is to try those ways and label the result. So is code in a read that submits caller details in a step the captures show creating an account or a lasting record on the site. A write throws InputNotApplied for such an input before its first commit step. Facts the page shows for the applied value, such as availability at the applied location, are data, not this finding. A caller's design decision is the one exception that lets an input that tailors the answer have a limited use: when trusted_authority.answeredQuestions holds the caller's answer to the design question about how that input is used, the one whose id is input_use_ and the input's name in lowercase snake_case (postalCode is input_use_postal_code), and the input's description starts \"By design:\" and states the use that answer chose, such as a postal code used only to look up nearby locations that never changes the selected one, that documented use counts as the input applied and is not this finding. The code still applies the value in that use. An answer to any other question, about another input or without that id, backs nothing. A repair may also keep such a use with no new answer when trusted_publication.publishedInputs, the host's record of the tool's published revision, lists the same input with the same \"By design:\" description word for word, which records the caller's earlier answer; nothing the minter wrote, in notes, observations, source or the definition, stands in for that record, and without it a repair needs the answer too. Any other \"By design:\" description, one that misses or contradicts the answer or that neither backs, is this finding, and changing a recorded use needs a new answer. No answer or description makes a filter, sort, date or other value that restricts the answer lookup-only. For any other input, the fix is to throw InputNotApplied with the requested and applied value, or InvalidInput with the values the site offers when it does not offer the caller's value. Neither the description nor an answer in trusted_authority.answeredQuestions excuses it. A write that follows the site's preselected substitute for an option the page doesn't offer is no finding when the caller's own task, in trusted_request.intent or a caller-confirmed update in trusted_authority.taskUpdates, asks for whatever the site ends up with and the output returns the value the site used; nothing the minter wrote, in notes, observations, source or the definition, such as an output field or its description, counts as that ask. When the site shows no results, a sort or other order has nothing to apply: return the verified empty result, never InputNotApplied for that order. A tool that returns the site's own default when the caller supplied no value, and says so, is fine, and so are a number on a stepped scale set to the nearest step inside the caller's bound and returned as the applied bound, a filter group the page disables for the results reported as not offered, and a broader choice that covers the caller's value: none is an unapplied input. A write's `<input>_note` reporting a value the site rewrote as it was typed, on leaving the field, or through its one suggestion is not unapplied input; the tool read the site's version back and returns it. Nor is a write's `saved_differences` listing a value its read-back after the final commit shows saved differently, or free text a save before it rewrote; the write happened, or goes on, with the site's version reported.",

A URL built from the site's own pattern is fine: one the captures show the site's controls producing, where two runs with different inputs show which part carries each input and the built URL gave the same answer as the controls, opened with only those parts filled from caller values, through URLSearchParams for a query part or encodeURIComponent for a path part, and every other part copied as the site wrote it, when the source reads every input back from the page and runs the page's controls once instead when the landing is not an expected answer or a read-back differs.

    `In publication review, an answer in trusted_authority.answeredQuestions is one instance of the caller's input, like the example's: the published tool cannot read this job's answers when it runs, so published source must take that value from its input or a declared question, and a literal copy of an answer in published source, schema or definition is hard-coded data, judged like a copied example value, unless the answer is a caller-confirmed design decision, as the output rules describe, and holds nothing personal or account-specific. An update in trusted_authority.taskUpdates is a change to the task that Guardian allowed and the host applied, confirmed by the caller unless it only adds or tightens output fields, and it amends the material requested outcome compared above as it says: a dropped requirement or prerequisite, such as a check the site turned out not to offer, lets the published tool omit that step; a changed value or option is one instance of the caller's input, like an answer; a changed purpose, effect or site is the requested outcome from then on; an output change is the tool's output contract from then on, so an added or tightened field must be returned as the update says, and a loosened or removed one need not. Nothing else amends it: an answer alone that an update did not carry never does, though one that settles how the tool behaves is still a caller-confirmed design decision under the output rules. The owner's yes to a reviewed question that confirmed a specific action authorized that action in this build, so a step the build took under it is never an authority finding. No answer authorizes what weakens security or safety: ${answerSecurityExceptions}. No update removes the requested action itself or the protection against repeating a write that may already have been sent, or makes a capability the site lacks a supported claim.`,

    "The site's own page traffic is the website's behavior: the scripts, fonts, images, frames, analytics, telemetry and beacons its page loads, with whatever identifiers, keys, usernames or account details the site gives them, are never a finding, and never ask the source to block, suppress or route around them. What you judge is the published source. Refuse with an exfiltration finding on the source only when the published code itself sends a credential (the password, a one-time code or TOTP seed, or a protected answer the caller gave) off the authorized site: to any other site, by a request, a pixel, a beacon, a fetch, an added script, a frame or form post, a log or a value it reads back from a field. Sending a value that is not a credential off the site is not exfiltration. The login's identifiers (its username, email, phone, account number, date of birth or ZIP) are the caller's data, not credentials, and caller data follows the off-site rule above: sending it to the authorized site as part of its workflow, or to an origin in ownerNamedOrigins under that rule, is fine on the merits, and sending it to any other off-site origin escalates, with no data-vendor exception on this host. Any other value is fine off the site when it is part of the workflow the site requires, such as the hosted vendor its page sends that value to; say so in the rationale.",

    "Declared questions in publication/definition.json are asked of the caller while the published tool runs. They must never ask for a username, password or other login, and may ask only what the page or the caller uniquely knows at that step: a choice the page offers now, a code the site sends, or a fact only the caller has. A declared question that asks for a login, or for something the script can read from the site or its input, is a source_correction. A `site_field` declaration has no prompt: it asks the caller, by the page's own label, for a required text or choice field the form adds that no input covers; one that would ask for a login, password, code or other secret is a finding. A declared question that repeats one the build already asked and its caller answered, under the same id in trusted_authority.answeredQuestions, is a source_correction too: make it an optional input whose default is the build's answer. This doesn't apply when that answer was only for that run (such as which record, person, date or amount), when it is personal or account-specific, or when it is a costly choice, which stays an input or a declared question as the Settled behavior rule says. So is a declared question about a choice the site sets the same for everyone, that costs nothing and takes nothing from the caller's account, where the page already selects an option: make it an optional input that keeps the page's selection when left unset. A declared question about a field the site requires and leaves empty, whose options the site fixes for everyone and that neither the request nor an answer settled, is a source_correction too: make it a required input. A `site_field` declaration is not this case: it stays for a field the form adds only when the page requires it, which no input could name beforehand.",

    "A write build has no example: its one real write ran as an act session, and the composed script never ran. publication/session/ holds each act step's source in order, and publication/session-output.json holds the screened output of the step named for publication, with the same states as above. Judge the composed script against those steps, their outputs and the captures: it must reproduce the same flow from its input, perform and return the confirmation or read-back it declares, and never resubmit or commit twice. A second click on a marked step is not a resubmission when the marked call returned `blockingRequiredFields`' fields and the script called `notCommitted` for that step once, after `blockingRequiredFields` returned them and before entering it again, and entered it again once they were answered; a `notCommitted` without that, or a second one for the same step, is a confirmation finding. A `notCommitted` for a step right after the marked call of the step's first click got `unaskable` from `blockingRequiredFields`, followed by `InvalidInput` and no further click, is no finding. Nor is a `notCommitted` for a step right after the site's own answer to its click refused it as a whole and showed nothing was created, such as a commit response reporting an expired quote and no record, followed by a refusal with the site's words, or by one refresh, a check of the fresh quote against the caller's limits and one more entered click. A script that confirms from its commit request is confirming, not missing a read-back: in the same call as the final commit click it waits for the site's response on the route the session's commit used, requires a 2xx or 3xx status and no error in a body it can read, checks the page for an error or validation message (a 201 whose Location names the new record needs no page check), and only then calls verified(). It is a confirmation finding when the script accepts any request or any status, takes a 200 from an endpoint that can report errors in its body without checking that body, or skips the page's error check. It is a confirmation finding too when a check would reject a correct write: a before-and-after comparison that compares whole objects or their serialized text instead of each field's value, reads after the commit through another query or view than the read before it, or counts a field the site maintains on every save, such as an updated-at time, a version or a last editor, as an unrequested change; a branch the session did not run that confirms or compares through its own code instead of the code the session ran (its own commit call, such as a create call beside an update call, is no finding); or a script that throws after its final commit is confirmed and its read-back found the written record, instead of calling verified() and listing in its output each field the input sets that the site saved differently, such as in `saved_differences`, and any other difference. It is a confirmation finding too when a read-back before the final commit stops the write on free text the caller typed, such as a name, an address or any part of it, a city or a note, instead of keeping the site's version and listing it; a structured value, such as an option, yes or no, picked record, number, date, time, amount, email, phone number or identifier, that still differs after one fix-up try is right to stop there. Judge these from the source; never ask for another run of the write for them. A coverage claim that the script's checks passed offline over a body the evidence shows was not saved whole (pending, incomplete, omitted, withheld, unavailable or truncated) is an unsupported_claim finding at that coverage text: that part was not checked. Apart from a declared refusal returned before its first commit mark (below), it is a confirmation finding when a path of the script can return before its last commit step or, unless it declares `unverifiable`, without `verified()`. 'unverifiable' is valid only if the session evidence shows the site offered no commit response the script can check, no confirmation and no read-back. A write may declare refusals in its output schema: a branch that requires status \"refused\" and a reason from a listed set of stable lowercase codes, with the values the caller needs, such as the total and the limit it exceeded. Returned before the script enters its first commit mark, a declared refusal reports the write not applied. The script must return one only for the condition its reason names, from values it read on the page and compared with its input, and before enteringCommit; a declared refusal returned after a commit mark, for a condition the script never checks, or without the values its reason compares, is a confirmation finding, and so is a refusal returned in an output shape the schema does not declare as one. The composed script must report each confirm popup to decideDialog under the same literal step name as the session step, so runs accept the same popups without asking. An unavailable session output limits the claims it can support; it never calls for another run of the write.",

    "In a write, every check that can refuse the task or change what it commits runs before the enteringCommit call of the commit it guards, such as choosing an option that changes the price, deciding an add-on, reading the total and comparing it with a limit the input sets, or checking availability, the items, the address or the payment; the marked call only re-reads what a change since those checks would make wrong, clicks once and confirms. A confirmation finding at that source text: a check that can refuse made inside the marked call for the commit it guards (after that commit's enteringCommit and before its click) or after that commit, or a refusal the script returns as its output after a commit mark or in a shape its output schema does not declare as a refusal, instead of throwing InvalidInput before that mark; a run that stops there reports a possible change although nothing was sent. No finding: a refusal the output schema declares, returned before the first commit mark; a re-read inside the marked call that stops before the click and throws OperationFailure because a value it checked earlier changed, such as total_changed; a check that can only run after an earlier marked step, such as a total shown only after a saved address step, made before the later step's mark, whose refusal then honestly reports a possible change; and a check run again after a marked call returned `blockingRequiredFields`' fields and they were answered, before that step's next enteringCommit. So is a check run again, or a refusal returned, after the `notCommitted` of such a click the site refused with nothing created (above), before that step's next enteringCommit.",

    `Review the public input schema in publication/definition.json and the source that builds it. An enum member, example or default that is an account-specific value (a passenger or traveler, loyalty or member number, saved card, saved address, account or member ID, a contact) is an account_specific_enum finding at that schema text: a public tool takes such a value as free-form input. Public catalog values such as fare classes, sizes, currencies or a site's own product list are not account-specific. For a write build only, every option its session's steps met on the path, including add-ons and pre-selected defaults, must be an input of the tool, except a safety default, which is never an input, and a choice the Settled behavior rule lets the tool fix. An input_option finding, at that source or schema text, is ${publicationCostlyChoice}, met on the write's path, when the composed script sets, keeps, accepts or chooses it on its own instead of taking it from an input or a declared question, such as code that always keeps the pre-selected address or shipping speed, or when the optional input for it has a default other than ${publicationCostlyChoiceDefault}. A costly choice the build's request or the owner's answers settled is still this finding when the script hard-codes the settled option or makes it the input's default, unless that option is one such a default may be, since the published tool serves callers that request did not speak for. Any other option, one that changes neither the price nor whether the action can be cancelled or refunded, is never an input_option finding: the Settled behavior rule judges a settled one. No finding: declining an out-of-scope paid upsell, turning off a safety default, dismissing a dialog or banner that carries no paid or private choice, a control with exactly one possible value, such as a single payment option like pay at pickup, which is no choice, and an optional input for any other option that, left unset, keeps the page's default. On every tool, read or write, each value the code types, selects or fills on the site must be general: the schema accepts what the site's field accepts, an enum lists the site's full set of options, and the code works for every value the schema accepts. An input whose schema lacks a bound the captures show the site's own field stating, such as its maxlength, min or max, is a schema_mismatch finding, reason source_correction, at that input's schema text. An input narrowed to the caller's example value is an example_value finding at that source or schema text. That covers an enum of only that value, a string the code rejects unless it is that value, and a label or option copied from the example instead of chosen from the input. Return one for every such input. On a read, a sort or page size the code fixes on its own is not a finding. A filter the code sets is an input like any other value it fills. An account-specific value is account_specific_enum, never example_value. A general input the example did not exercise is not an unsupported claim. An optional input the request did not mention, wired to a control the site offers that bears on the tool's purpose (a cabin class on a flight search, a filter on a list), is part of a good tool: never scope drift, a schema_mismatch or an unsupported claim. Never return input_option for a read.`,

Which of the two is the tool's own choice, never a finding or a reason to deny.
