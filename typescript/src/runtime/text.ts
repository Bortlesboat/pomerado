 * Whether `shown`, text read from the page, names what `wanted` names, as a person reads them.
 * Case, accents on Latin, Greek and Cyrillic letters, spacing and apostrophes are ignored, and so
 * are periods, commas and hyphens between letters, while marks that change a word in other scripts,
 * such as Hindi, Thai and Japanese, still count. A word `shown` writes short, such as St for Saint
 * or Blvd for Boulevard, matches the full word in `wanted` when it starts with the same letter,
 * keeps its letters in order and is at most half as long. This holds only for words of Latin
 * letters, never inside an email, domain or file name. A short word in `wanted` never matches a
 * longer one in `shown`, so a wanted Pen never matches a shown Pencil. Both texts need the same
 * number of words in the same order, and a word holding a digit or another symbol, such as a slash
 * or a bracket, must be the same word, so 12 never matches 123, C++ never matches C and Blue/Green
 * never matches Blue Green. A space, hyphen, dash, slash or parentheses between digits is one
 * separator, whichever it is, so 29 59, 29-59 and 29/59 match, and so do (317) 555-1234 and
 * 317-555-1234, but the groups it separates count: 1/12 never matches 11/2, 1 234 never matches
 * 12 34 and 2959 never matches 29 59. One period or comma between a number's digits is its
 * decimal mark, whichever it is, and zeros after it drop, so 1,5 matches 1.5, 28,0 matches 28 and
 * 8,20 matches 8.2, while 1,5 never matches 15, 1,25 never matches 1.2 and 10.0 never matches 100.
 * Three digits after a lone mark may be thousands, so 1,250 and 1.250 stay as written and never
 * match 1.25, and a number right after a letter is a code, so v2.10 never matches v2.1. Compare
 * dates and amounts with `readBackMatches`, which reads them as values.
 *
 * With `{ rewrite: true }`, `shown` is the site's own version of a value the tool typed, `wanted`,
 * such as an address the site standardized as it was entered, and the answer is whether it kept
 * everything the caller gave. It only tells a rewrite that reformatted the value from one that
 * changed it, and never decides whether a write goes on. Every word and number of `wanted` must
 * appear in `shown`, in order. A word may be written short or in full either way, with the same
 * first letter, its letters in order and a short form of two letters or more, at most three fifths
 * as long as the full word, and of two letters when it is the full word's start. So Parkway
 * matches PKWY, Suite matches STE and St matches Street, either way, while Main never matches
 * Martin, Mainland or M, Larkspur never matches Lark, Oakwood never matches Oak and Avenue never
 * matches Ave. A number reads as above and keeps its groups, though the site may pad a group of a
 * grouped number with zeros, as 01/12 for 1/12, or add thousands commas to a bare one, as 1,420
 * for 1420, and three or more groups split by periods, as in 555.123.4567, are groups as a hyphen
 * splits them. A bare number of seven digits or more, a phone or account number, may come back
 * grouped, so 5551234567 matches (555) 123-4567, but a shorter one never does and a grouped one
 * never comes back regrouped or bare, so 1420 never matches 14-20 and 29-59 never matches 2959.
 * What the site adds is a change, a word holding a digit, a unit or a place alike, so Apt 4 never
 * matches Apt 4B, and 1420 Larkspur Rd never matches 1420-2 Larkspur Rd or 1420 Larkspur Rd
 * Apt 2, with three exceptions: a word of one or two Latin letters between two of the caller's,
 * as 100 N Main St adds N to 100 Main St; a country code before a number, as +1 before
 * (555) 123-4567; and one more group after a postal code of five digits or more that ends the
 * caller's value, so 46204 matches 46204-1234. Other punctuation is ignored. A dropped or changed
 * word or number fails, so 1420 Oak Road, Springfield never matches 1420 Oak Rd, Riverton, except
 * a country code the caller typed where the site shows none. An email, domain or file name, or a
 * `wanted` with no letter or digit, compares as it does without the option.
 *
 * It is pure and self-contained, so page code can embed it.

/**
 * How much of `query`'s words each of `texts` holds, by BM25 (Okapi BM25 with k1 1.2 and b 0.75,
 * and Lucene's word weight), with `texts` as the set that weighs each word: a word few of them
 * hold counts for more. Each score is the text's BM25 score for the query over the query's own
 * score as a text, so a text holding every word of the query once and no other scores 1, it falls
 * as the query's words go missing or the text adds others, and 0 is a text sharing no word with
 * it. A text that repeats the query's words can score above 1, as "Smith Smith Smith" does for
 * Smith. Apart from the numbers rule below, ranking texts by it ranks them by plain BM25.
 *
 * Words are read as `foldChoiceText` reads names: case, accents, apostrophes and periods, commas
 * and hyphens between letters are ignored. A whole text that names one date, such as
 * "Nov 5, 2026", "5 November 2026", "2026-11-05" or "25/11/2026", is one word, that date, unless
 * its day and month could be either way round, as in "03/04/2026". A whole text of 7 to 15 digits
 * with only spaces, periods, hyphens, brackets and a leading +, other than a decimal number such
 * as 1500000.00 or 1234567.8, is one word, all its digits, so a phone or account number matches
 * however it is spaced, and 14155551234 never matches 4155551234. Thousands commas and currency
 * symbols are dropped, and one period or comma between a number's digits is its decimal mark, as
 * `sameText` reads it, with the zeros after it dropped, so $1,250.00 matches 1250, ¥1,500,000
 * matches 1500000, 1,50 matches 1.5 and 28,0 matches 28, while 1,250 is 1250 and 1.250 stays as
 * written. An email, domain or file name, a word whose digits are joined by a slash, period or
 * hyphen, such as 1.5 or ACCT-0042, and a number with a sign before or after it, such as -5 or 5+,
 * each stay one word, so 12 never matches 123 or 1.2, 1234567.8 never matches 12345678, and 5
 * never matches -5. A run of single letters is one word, so U.S.A. matches USA.
 *
 * Numbers must match exactly: a text whose words holding a digit, read as above, are not the
 * query's, the same ones in the same order, scores 0 whatever else it shares. So 125 Main St never
 * matches 123 Main St, 500000 never matches 300000, "Adults 2 Children 1" never matches
 * "Adults 1 Children 2", and "5 15" never matches 5. The words around them may move, so
 * "Main St 123" matches "123 Main St". Any other word counts only by its BM25 weight, so a
 * negation such as "not" or "non" is one more word.
 *
 * It is pure and self-contained, so page code can embed it.

/**
 * Whether text read back from the page, `shown`, confirms `wanted`: `sameText(shown, wanted)`
 * holds, or `shown` holds enough of `wanted`'s words, a `rankByWords` score for `wanted` of 0.7 or
 * more with `shown` as the only text. `wanted` is the label of the option the tool picked when it
 * picked one, and the caller's value otherwise, since California never confirms a caller's CA
 * that the tool picked as California. Case, accents,
 * spacing and punctuation between letters are ignored either way. The second step accepts the
 * wanted words in another order and among other words: a one-word value is confirmed by text
 * that adds up to two words to it, and text that drops one of the wanted words is not, unless the
 * value has eleven words or more. So a wanted name inside a longer one, such as Lakeside in North
 * Lakeside, is confirmed. `shown` must hold the numbers `wanted` holds and no others, in the same
 * order: dates, phone numbers, amounts and decimals as `rankByWords` reads them, so 1,875 confirms
 * 1875 and a site's 1,50 confirms a caller's 1.5, and other numbers the same, so 125 Main St never
 * confirms 123 Main St, 1,5 never confirms 15 and "5 15" never confirms 5.
 * It calls `sameText` and `rankByWords`, so page code that embeds it embeds those two first.
