/**
 * Saves one page of a form saved over several pages and reads back each value of `wanted` from
 * what the site stored. `wanted` holds each field the site shows for the caller's values: the
 * label of the option the tool picked when it picked one, such as California for a caller's CA,
 * and the caller's value otherwise. `save` fills the page with the same entries and saves it,
 * behind its commit mark. Use it only for a save that updates the same record or page, never one
 * that adds an item, such as a cart line or a row, since its second save would add another.
 * `read` reads what the site saved for each field, from a summary, a review page or the saved
 * page, with null or no entry for a field it no longer shows, which counts as differing.
 * Each field is compared with `readBackMatches`. When one differs, it saves once more and reads
 * back again, and never saves a third time. `freeText` names fields of free text the caller typed,
 * such as a name, address, city or note: when only they differ, it returns without saving again,
 * since the tool keeps the site's version and lists it. It returns the fields that still differ,
 * in `wanted`'s order, empty when the site kept every value, so the tool stops before its final
 * commit on a structured value among them and lists free text in its output. A save or read that
 * throws ends it with that error.
