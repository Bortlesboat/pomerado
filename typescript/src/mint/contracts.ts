/**
 * How the minter ends a build its task makes impossible as asked:
 * - `site_lacks_capability`: the site does not offer what the task needs.
 * - `site_declined`: the site offers what the task needs but declines this example's own facts,
 *   such as an applicant it will not quote; the explanation names the reason the site gave.
 * - `site_unavailable`: the site is temporarily down for the failing input: its own pages show a
 *   maintenance or outage page, or fail with a 5xx answer from its own service, while the tool's
 *   code and the caller's input are unchanged, never a 5xx answer only to the request the tool
 *   made, since that request can be wrong. Nothing is wrong with the task, so a host may offer a
 *   retry later.
 * - `policy`: Guardian refused an execution with refusal `final`, or refused a publication for a
 *   reason no correction gets past (`publicationRefusalUnfixable`), in this attempt, and nothing
 *   within authority gets past it. An execution refusal Guardian marked `correctable` is never one.
 * - `owner_declined`: the owner explicitly said no to a step the build needs: a confirm question
 *   answered no, or a login request declined.
 * - `question_unanswered`: a question the build needed went unanswered, and the build cannot go
 *   on without its answer.
 * - `owner_ended`: the owner chose in an answer to end the build, such as after confirming that a
 *   fact it needs is unknown. Never the caller's error or the site's refusal.
 * - `host_refused`: a host check, not Guardian and not the site, refused a step the build needs in
 *   this attempt, such as a publication, a sign-in form or a site change, and nothing left in the
 *   attempt can fix it. The host records those refusals itself. It also stands on live tests the
 *   host refuses, with no batch left, while Guardian's denial of the latest publication stands.
 * - `caller_input`: the caller's own request stops the build: what it states conflicts with itself
 *   or its cited sources, a file it needs is missing, or it rules out going on, such as a stop
 *   condition it set that cannot be met. A missing fact the caller could supply is asked instead.
 *   A stop the site caused on its own, such as an expired quote, a block, an outage or a site
 *   error, is not `caller_input`, even when the request says to stop on it.
 *   Its basis is the report's `intent` citing the request: a field its input holds or words of its
 *   instruction (`citesCallerRequest`), or a task update the owner confirmed in an answer, by its
 *   revision or its words (`citesConfirmedUpdate`), such as a stop condition the owner picked that
 *   the build then met. The explanation says what the caller should supply or change. Optional:
 *   no host has to handle it until its core reports it.
 * - `agent_declined`: the minter itself declined the requested task under its own usage policy,
 *   and no change it could ask for would make it build it. It needs no refusal on record, and
 *   Guardian reviews its explanation like any blocked ending. Never a site's, Guardian's or the
 *   owner's refusal. Optional: no host has to handle it until its core reports it.
 * The host refuses each ending without its basis on record. A `policy` report whose only basis is
 * the owner's no or an unanswered question ends as `owner_declined` or `question_unanswered`. A
 * target on another registrable domain is never a reason by itself: Guardian reviews such work.
