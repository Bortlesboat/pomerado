/**
 * Fills the values into the step's fields, in order, and clicks its submit, on the stable primary tab or its inspected authentication popup,
 * judging every control again before each call acts. Kernel calls
 * focus and bind each field and click; the host inserts each value atomically into that original
 * node over its own encrypted DevTools socket (`keyboard`), so no value but a date of birth ever enters a Kernel call's script text or
 * its request to Kernel's REST API. It reports per-field outcomes and never a
 * value. Once anything was typed, a call that fails or finds a control refused can no longer say
 * nothing reached the site: a lost answer is `uncertain`, a control refused before a field's typing
 * fails that field, and one refused before the click, or a submission refused as it fires, refuses
 * the submit. That click ran, though, so the report says so (`clicked`): the page's own handlers
 * ran on it, and what the step filled may have gone out. A submit the page keeps disabled is never
 * clicked: the host waits for the page to enable it once the fields are filled. When it stays
 * disabled after the host typed a field, the host types every field again key by key
 * (`InsertionOptions.keys`), for a page that enables it only on key presses, and waits once more.
 * When it still stays disabled the report says so (`stayed_disabled`). A step whose code the host
 * typed one character per box into several code fields is submitted only once every box holds
 * exactly one character; otherwise that box fails and the submit is not attempted. A phone field is
 * read back once typed (`InsertionOptions.phone`): one that kept other digits than the number, as
 * under a country picker set to another country, is `changed`, and the fill types nothing more and
 * never clicks the submit. On a step with fields and no submit, a page that moves on once every
 * field is typed sent what was typed itself (`page`), never a refusal:
 * the step's fields went away or were all disabled, its popup closed, its address moved to another
 * path, or a step of several fields came back emptied. The host gives the page up to `pageSendMs`
 * to do so, and a submit call that fails meanwhile is followed by another look (`submitWhenEnabled`).
 * A step with a submit is the host's to click, whatever its page does meanwhile, unless a new
 * document took the place of the one the host typed the last field in, and the step's fields went
 * with it, before the click or within `pageSendMs` of a look that found them gone: the page sent
 * the form itself (`page`, `screenGone`, `awaitNewDocument`), and the host clicks nothing. A form
 * that locks, redraws itself or changes its address with pushState has sent nothing, and the host
 * waits on it or refuses as before. A code step gets the same looks once every box is typed, when
 * its submit call finds a box empty or fails, or the last box's typing loses its answer, as when
 * its page sends the code itself on the last digit and loads a new document while the host checks
 * the boxes (`codeSentBySite`). Its fields gone with a new document within `pageSendMs` is `page`,
 * with every box filled; else the report is as it would have been. A step whose every field takes
 * a code, whose submit call finds its submit or a field gone from the very document the host typed
 * in, gets the same looks, and when no new document comes is `refused` with `closedInPlace`: it may
 * have sent the code itself and closed in place, which only the sign-in's own check can tell.
 * Guardian's refusals still come first: a control that moved off the site or changed how it
 * submits refuses the submit as before.
 * A step that names `dismiss` clicks that covering notice's own control first, when the page shows
 * it, and refuses the step with nothing typed when it is no such control (`dismissNotice`). A
 * click another element caught, which never reached the submit, is `blocked`, with that element
 * (`blockedBy`): nothing was sent and the fields still hold what was typed, so the minter can name
 * the element's own control as `dismiss` and send the screen again (`resubmitAutofillStep`), which
 * presses the submit from the keyboard only when its click is caught again. On a step that names
 * `dismiss`, a notice drawn only once the fields were typed is dismissed then, and the submit
 * clicked once more, with nothing typed again. A click that ran out of time while the next page
 * loaded, as one through a slow chain of redirects does, is `clicked` once a request for the page's
 * main frame went out, whatever the site answered, and the page gets the settle wait from there;
 * with no such request it is `failed`.
