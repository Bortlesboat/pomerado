/**
 * Page code: where each code field sits among its screen's one-character boxes, as
 * `Described.codeBox` says, else null. A box is a visible, enabled, editable text input that takes
 * one character:
 * - by its `maxlength` of 1, among the like boxes of its screen, the field's form, or its document
 *   or shadow root outside one;
 * - or, with no `maxlength` limit, by the page's own script, as many one-time-code widgets limit
 *   their boxes, when the step names two or more code fields: among the visible, enabled, editable
 *   text inputs that are children of its parent element, when those are two to
 *   `maximumCodeBoxes`, all of its type and none with a `maxlength` limit. A field that is the only
 *   such input in its parent counts one level up instead, among its parent and the parent's
 *   siblings, when each of them holds one such input as its only element. Elements that show no
 *   box, such as a hidden input, a style element or a message not shown, count at neither level.
 *   When the step's boxes found so disagree on how many there are, or two take one place, as boxes
 *   split between two containers do, none of them is a box.
 * A field that is no box, or a screen with fewer than two, has none. Attributes only, never a value.
 * When the step names one code field and it is the first box of such a row by its `maxlength`, as
 * a code screen the recipe never recorded may show, `codeBoxRow` names each other box of that same
 * row, in order, by a selector that matches it alone in its document or shadow root: its id, else
 * its name, else its `aria-label`. A row with a box none of those name alone, or with more than
 * `maximumCodeBoxes` boxes, has none.

 * - `date`: fills a date of birth with the authoring library's `fillDate`, which needs the page's

 *
 * One that sits in the sign-in's form, or would submit a form, is still clicked when it sits in a
 * notice that covers one of the step's controls (`noticeCoverCode`) and every control a click of it
 * may reach that submits a form sits in that notice too: some pages wrap the whole page in one form, notice
 * included, and give the notice a button with no type. First the step's fields are emptied
 * (`emptied`), so nothing typed sits in the form while the page's own code runs, and the host
 * types them again; a field it cannot empty keeps the notice unclicked (`failed`). For that click
 * alone, capture listeners on its window cancel the default action of every click that reaches the
 * notice and every submit event, so the page's own handler runs and neither the click nor the
 * handler's own requestSubmit submits a form; the host removes them once the tasks the click
 * queued ran. What the page's own code sends regardless, by a form's submit(), fetch or XHR, or
 * once the listeners are off, holds nothing typed, as the fields are empty until the host types
 * them again. When the page's own code starts a navigation in the meantime, such as a reload or
 * that submit(), the call waits for the new document, and the next call finds the step's controls
 * again before anything is typed.
